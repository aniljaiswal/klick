                <p>Klick is Kellogg’s only app for meeting new students and organizing small group events.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to make it easier for students to forge new connections with other students they wouldn’t normally meet. We believe we can help diversify individual networks at Kellogg and make our school a more inclusive environment.</p>

                <h3>What is KETI?</h3>
                <p>Klick is part of Kellogg Education Technology Incubator (KETI). KETI’s mission is to help Kellogg create the premier technology experience amongst business schools by harnessing the power of student-led innovation. We were one of the winner’s of KETI’s 2014 business plan competition.</p>

                <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                <p>We are Ritwik Manan, Rahul Gaur, and Drew Crail, three second years at Kellogg who want to make our school as connected as possible. We’re thankful to the original founders Phil Brown (’16), Ashley Jurinka(’16), and Ryan Lee(’16) who had this wonderful idea and built it along with Nikhil Pai (NU undergrad ’16). We hope you love using Klick as much as we love growing it.</p>
